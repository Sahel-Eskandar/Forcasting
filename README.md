# Forcasting


In this [article](https://medium.com/@eskandar.sahel/arima-vs-lstm-a-comparative-analysis-of-time-series-forecasting-for-stock-price-prediction-45b6fcf5ac10) we show that predicting stock prices is a challenging task, and ARIMA might not be the best choice. More advanced models, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks or Facebookâ€™s Prophet, are designed to handle complex time series data and could potentially yield better results.

You can find the Jupyther notebook implementation (ARIMAvsLSTM.ipynb) in this repository.
